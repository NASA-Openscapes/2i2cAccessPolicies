# 2i2c Access Policies for NASA Openscapes Users
This repository is a place for us to develop draft policies for NASA-Openscapes, originally drafted by Erin Robinson.
The current version of our access policies can be found in the [Earthdata Cloud Cookbook](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/policies-admin/).

## Scripts and tools
We also use this repository to store code we use to help understand and implement
our policies:

- Archive user directories: 
  - [Data Storage Policy](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/policies-admin/data-policies.html)
  - [Python script](scripts/archive-home-dirs.py) and [documentation](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/policies-admin/data-policies.html)
- Monitoring cloud usage costs:
  - [Policy](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/policies-admin/#monitoring-cloud-usage-costs)
  - Automated report (coming soon)

[**What's happening on the NASA Openscapes Hub!?**](https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/discussions/2) is a thread to  share stories big and small about your experiences using the Hub for science and teaching. These stories are important to communicate the value of hosting cloud resources so that we can continue to do so, so we appreciate you sharing your experiences. Thank you!
great things you are using the hub for.
